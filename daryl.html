        <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0384/2903/2492/products/510TUdi9fiL._AC_SL1001_467a84de-407c-43b8-9660-c6a0ad6f2049_2048x2048.jpg?v=1626553804" alt="new gadget" width="500px">

        <h2>Solar Powered Tent</h2>
        <p class="tagline">A home like gadget</p>
        <img src="https://www.inspiredcamping.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Solar-Powered-Tent-Orange-Concept-Tent-896x560.gif" alt="new gadget" width="500px">

        <p>This tent is also solar powered. The idea is that specially coated solar threads are woven into the conventional fabric so designers wouldn’t have to use fixed solar panels to harness the energy. It would also have three directional glides that
            can be moved throughout the day to maximise solar efficiency and energy collection. This takes the form of a heating element that’s embedded within the tent’s groundsheet giving underfloor heating that can be triggered automatically once the
            temperature falls below a set level. </p>
