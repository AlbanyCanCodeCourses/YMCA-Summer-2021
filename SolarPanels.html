    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. ... Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity</p>

    <h1>Details of my Topic</h1>
    <p>Solar panels are those devices which are used to absorb the sun's rays and convert them into electricity or heat. </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is my Site for the Solar panels. I'm going to show what it does for us and how it's helping us.

        <h2>Specific Detail</h2>

        <h2>Specific Detail</h2>
        <p> Multiple cells make up a solar panel, and multiple panels (modules) can be wired together to form a solar array.</p>
        <p> Solar panels are made of photovoltaic cells that capture sunlight and turn it into direct current electricity (DC electricity). This happens whenever sun rays are hitting your solar panels, rain or shine. The inverter converts the DC electricity
            into alternating current electricity, or AC electricity, to be used by your home. The electricity can now provide power to your home.</p>
