    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy.Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity</p>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This is my Site for the Solar panels. I'm going to show what it does for us and how it's helping us.Each individual panel is constructed of a layer of silicon cells, a metal frame, a glass casing surrounded by a special film, and wiring. For maximum
        effect, the panels are grouped together into “arrays” (an ordered series) and placed on rooftops or in large outdoor spaces. The solar cells, which are also referred to as photovoltaic cells, absorb sunlight during daylight hours. </p>

    <h2> Details of my Topic</h2>
    <p>Solar panels are those devices which are used to absorb the sun's rays and convert them into electricity or heat. </p>

        <h2>Specific Detail</h2>

        <p>Solar panels use the photons produced by sunlight to generate direct current (DC) electricity. When the photons hit the panel they are absorbed by the panel's semiconducting silicon material. During this process electrons separate from the atoms
            and move around the solar cell.
            <h2>Specific Detail</h2>
            <p> Multiple cells make up a solar panel, and multiple panels (modules) can be wired together to form a solar array.</p>
