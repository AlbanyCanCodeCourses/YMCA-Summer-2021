            <h1>Intro</h1>
            <p>Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy.Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity. The solar inverters on panels usually last between 10-12
                years and typically need replacing at least once over the panel's lifetime. The power inverters are crucial for safe and efficient operation of solar panels. Extending the lifetime can have significant advantages to the cost and function
                of a solar system.</p>

            <h1>About Site</h1>
            <p>This is my Site for the Solar panels. I'm going to show what it does for us and how it's helping us.Each individual panel is constructed of a layer of silicon cells, a metal frame, a glass casing surrounded by a special film, and wiring. For
                maximum effect, the panels are grouped together into “arrays” (an ordered series) and placed on rooftops or in large outdoor spaces. The solar cells, which are also referred to as photovoltaic cells, absorb sunlight during daylight hours.

        <div class="Details of Solar Panels">
            <h2> Details of Sonar Panels</h2>
            <p>Solar panels are those devices which are used to absorb the sun's rays and convert them into electricity or heat.The average home in the United States is roughly 1500 square feet. With a home of this size, the typical electric bill comes in
                around $100 month. In order to cover the electricity for this home, you would need an estimated 15-18 solar panels. </p>

            <h2>Interesting Fact #1</h2>
            <p>Solar panels use the photons produced by sunlight to generate direct current (DC) electricity. When the photons hit the panel they are absorbed by the panel's semiconducting silicon material. During this process electrons separate from the
                atoms and move around the solar cell.</p>

            <h2>Interesting Fact #2</h2>
            <p> Multiple cells make up a solar panel, and multiple panels (modules) can be wired together to form a solar array.How many solar panels will you need? To make up a 5kW solar system, you need 17 solar panels, assuming you use 300W panels – that
                will actually give you 5.1kW. Each panel will be about 1.6m x 1m, so you'll need at least 17.2m² of roof space.</p>
